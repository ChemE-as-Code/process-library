# Context: independent review job of the ammonia-1 platform-paper run

You are an **independent reviewer** session for one section of the ammonia-1 design
(process-library#86). Another session wrote it; do not assume it is correct. Your working
directory is `processes/ammonia-1` in the worktree of the section's branch; find its PR with
`gh pr list --head "$(git branch --show-current)" --state open`.

## Review
1. Read `runs/plan.md` (the section's target and gates), the PR body and the full diff
   (`gh pr diff`, `cheme diff origin/main --list`, quoted in the record).
2. Re-run the checks yourself (never trust the PR body): `cheme validate`, `cheme check`,
   `cheme maturity`, and the section's own commands (e.g. `cheme process simulate --check`,
   `cheme safety hazop check`, `cheme layout build --check`, `cheme datasheets ...`).
3. Engineering correctness for this technology: balances and units, plausibility of key numbers
   against general engineering knowledge and the cited sources (spot-check two cited values
   against the source), provenance (given/assumed/calculated) honest, no gate relaxed, skipped
   or accepted, no invented data, no third-party content copied, scope kept to the section.
4. Write `reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic>.md` with the front matter of `reviews/README.md`
   (`topic` as the plan's gate expects, e.g. `design` or `layout` where a review gate needs it,
   `reviewed_commit` = HEAD, `scope`, `reviewer: review-agent`, `reviewer_kind: agent`,
   `branch`, `merge: pending`), findings with ids, severity (critical | high | medium | low),
   file/line, what is wrong, the fix. Carry forward the open findings of earlier records. Do not
   inflate severities. Commit it and push the branch (`git push`; never force, never to main).
5. Post a short PR comment with the verdict and the findings by severity.

## Verdict and merge
- `VERDICT: approve` only if no critical or high finding is open and the section's gates pass
  as the plan states (or the gap is a documented core limit the plan allows).
- If the task says the section ends with a stage sign-off: on approve, do **not** merge; end.
- Otherwise on approve: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/main` (never rebase), push,
  `gh pr checks <n> --watch` until green, then `gh pr merge <n> --merge`.
- End your answer with two lines: first `VERDICT: approve` or `VERDICT: fix`, then `STATUS: DONE`
  (the runner recognises `STATUS:` lines; the orchestrator reads the verdict line).


# Review this section's PR: S5 of ammonia-1 (PR #257), round 2
Review topic for the record: `design`.
This section ends with a stage sign-off: on `VERDICT: approve` do **not** merge.
Branch: stage/basic-layout (checked out). Earlier sections are merged on main.

## S5 3D layout, MTO and class 4 estimate (branch stage/basic-layout)
3D layout (skills `layout-yaml`, `pipe-routing`, `structures-access`, `area-classification`):
every DN25 and larger process line routed, zones declared, gates layout-3d, lifting-study, mto;
MTO and class 4 estimate (`cheme assess mto`, `cheme assess estimate`, skill `mto-estimate`) and
TEA updated; enable the template gate `tea` as documented.

## S5r basic reviews and sign-off (on stage/basic-layout)
Two independent review jobs: a design review (topic `design`, the P&IDs, lists, control and
simulation of S2-S4) and a layout review (topic `layout`). Then the basic sign-off job and the
merge job.



At the very end, before the VERDICT line, add one line exactly like `FINDINGS: critical=<n> high=<n> medium=<n> low=<n>` counting only the findings new in this review (not carried ones).
