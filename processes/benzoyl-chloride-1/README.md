A plant design kept as plain files in git: DEXPI 2.0.1 P&IDs in `pid/`, engineering lists as
YAML, decisions and progress as Markdown. Edited by people and by coding agents (Claude Code),
checked by [`cheme-as-code`](https://github.com/ChemE-as-Code/core).

A batch plant: the reactor R101 is a semi-batch (`reactor: semibatch`, benzotrichloride dosed
into molten benzoic acid with zinc chloride) whose HCl leaves as it forms by a vent stream
(`batch.vent`, core ADR 0054) to the absorber; its maximum technical temperature is given as
`hazard.mtt`. The crude is distilled in a batch still, ST101, which core integrates as one
Rayleigh stage (`still:`, core ADR 0055); the rectification in the column on top of it, K101,
is a specified split from `scripts/balance.py` until core has a batch column with reflux
(core#173). `process/recipe.yaml` holds the batch recipe the cycle time, R-101's vessel and
jacket check, the still's boil-up time and the flowsheet's year-average flows come from
(`cheme process recipe`, `cheme process reactor-hazards`, `cheme process stills`). Needs
cheme-as-code 1.8.0.

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `plant.yaml` | name, stage, sheets |
| `pid/` | P&ID sheets (DEXPI 2.0.1 XML); none yet |
| `process/design-basis.yaml` | capacity, feeds, products, utilities, site |
| `process/materials.yaml`, `process/flowsheet.yaml`, `process/reactions.yaml` | components (with the still's Antoine constants), blocks, steps, streams and reactions: the source of the generated BFD and PFD (`process/*.xml`, `cheme process build`) |
| `process/recipe.yaml` | the batch recipe: batch size, unit procedures, R-101's vessel and jacket, the still's distil time (`cheme process recipe`) |
| `equipment/equipment-list.yaml`, `piping/line-list.yaml`, `control/instrument-list.yaml` | lists, consistent with the P&IDs |
| `control/cause-effect.yaml` | interlocks and trips (cause and effect) |
| `safety/` | HAZOP studies (`safety/hazop/<id>/study.yaml`) and the risk matrix they rate against; `safety/README.md` says how |
| `lca/` | the preliminary gate-to-gate LCI (`lca/lca.yaml`; the rest written by `cheme assess lca --write`) |
| `checks/checks.yaml` | engineering-step gates; `checks/status.json` their result at the last stage sign-off |
| `reviews/` | review records |
| `runs/` | one record per design session, written by `cheme runs record` (`runs/README.md`); never edited |
| `DESIGN.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `STAGES.md` | decisions, change log, stage definitions |
| `scripts/` | generator scripts and `balance.py`: the feeds for 2000 t/a, the column's split, the absorber water and the duties (D-006) |
| `.claude/skills/` | how an agent works here (not in git: run `cheme skills update` once after cloning) |

## How this repository works

- **This repository holds your plant**: drawings, lists, decisions. It does not hold the tools.
- **The tools come from [`cheme-as-code`](https://github.com/ChemE-as-Code/core)**, installed once on
  your computer (`uv tool install git+https://github.com/ChemE-as-Code/core.git`). Every check,
  drawing and generated file is made by the `cheme` command, so you need it to work here. The CI
  of the process library installs it too.
- **Licences.** This folder is part of the ChemE-as-Code process library. Its data and designs are
  under CC BY 4.0 (`LICENSE-DATA`, unless `process.yaml` states otherwise); its skills and scripts
  are under AGPL-3.0-or-later (`LICENSE`), like the ChemE-as-Code tools.
- **The skills in `.claude/skills/` are not in git.** They come with cheme-as-code: run
  `cheme skills update` once in this folder after cloning, so that Claude Code finds them here. Run
  it again after upgrading (`uv tool upgrade cheme-as-code`); `cheme skills status` shows which are
  out of date. A skill you changed here is kept, but only on your machine.

## Working here

```sh
uv tool install 'cheme-as-code[serve] @ git+https://github.com/ChemE-as-Code/core.git'   # once (see the cheme-as-code README)
cheme git-setup                 # once per clone: readable P&ID diffs + pre-commit hook
cheme skills update             # once per clone: installs the agent skills in .claude/skills/
cheme status                    # where the plant stands: sheets, findings, gates, sign-offs
cheme validate                  # after every change
cheme check                     # engineering-step gates (--write only at sign-off)
cheme process build             # BFD and PFD from process/*.yaml
cheme process streams           # stream table with provenance, block balances
cheme process propagate --check # the semi-batch with its vent, the still and the mixers
cheme process recipe            # batch cycle, bottleneck, batches per year, vessel, jacket, off-gas (--svg)
cheme process reactor-hazards   # thermal screening, with the semi-batch's accumulation
cheme process stills            # the still's distillate, residue, boil-up time and duty per batch
cheme run scripts/balance.py    # the feeds for 2000 t/a, the column's split and the duties
cheme assess lca --check        # the LCI files current
```
