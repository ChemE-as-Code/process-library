You are revising the process-library case study Acetone and phenol (cumene process) (`processes/acetone-1/`, branch
`case/acetone-1`, issue #132) after an independent review. Read the newest record in
`reviews/` and close every **critical and high** finding (medium/low only where quick).

First, the pull request's CI failed: run `gh pr checks 210` and `gh run view <run id> --log-failed` (read-only) and fix the causes inside this folder.

Follow this folder's AGENTS.md and the library rules in `../../CLAUDE.md`. Do not edit anything
outside `processes/acetone-1/`; never edit an existing review record or run record. For each
finding you close, append a short "Response" entry to PROGRESS.md (finding id, what changed,
commit). Re-run `cheme check`, `cheme maturity`, `cheme process streams` and
`cheme assess lca --coverage` afterwards. Commit everything; do not push.
End with a short report: findings closed (ids), findings left open and why.
